The goal of braidReports is to provide simple, intuitive, flexible tools to 
visualize combined action analyses and response surfaces, building on the power
and breadth of the `ggplot2` plotting system.


## Example BRAID Analsyis and Report

Here is how you would run a full BRAID analysis (using the `braidrm` example
dataset `synergisticExample`) and produce a one-page report:

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(braidReports)
## Run and Report a BRAID Analysis:
surface <- synergisticExample

analysis <- runBraidAnalysis(measure ~ concA + concB, surface, defaults=c(0,1))

report <- makeBraidReport(analysis, c("A Drug","B Drug"),
						  levels=c(0.5, 0.9), limits=c(5,5))

```
